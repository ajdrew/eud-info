# EUD Info

![EUD with radio](/resources/pictures/eud-with-radio.png)

EUDs (End User Devices) are the hot ticket item for your tactical kit. They are the latest iteration of injecting technology into the shoot, move, communicate protocol. They are basically mobile devices with rugged cases and armor mounts running ATAK (Android Tactical Assault Kit). ATAK provides mapping, data sharing, communications, and asset coordination for a group. However, while ATAK is very much a mature product for the military, it is difficult for the average person to fully grasp and implement all the features of ATAK. This stunted use on the civilian side of the house comes from the lack of resources ATAK was originally released with and the lack of easy implementation documentation. Both resources for both individual and server-based implementation of ATAK have definitely improved, but are still time intensive to setup and fully grasp. Large events, such as Milsim West, are now using ATAK to monitor health and status of players and teams for unit level organization.

## Examples of EUDs Mounted to Armor:

### Chest Mount

Currently, to put together a functional EUD that will withstand hard use, is rather difficult and expensive. The trick is to find an older series phone that is affordable along with a case and mount. Your plate carrier also needs to have a MOLLE field at the top of the chest or acceptable connectors for an adaptor. 

### Magazine Mount

An alternative to chest mounted systems above the magazines is to mount it in front of the magazines. The common above-the-magazine mounting style may get in the way of getting magazines in and out quickly. However, mounting it in front of the magazines contributes to "tactical pregnancy" and not going prone as easily.

## Case Manufacturers:
There are only a few case manufacturers aside from the Chinesium copies. Here is the general breakdown.
